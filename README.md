# KF6017-Project

GIT REPO DOES NOT EXECUTEABLE:      
I used Visual Studio 2022 as an IDE - Configuration: Debug Win32   

This game is a platformer, the aim is to reach the top of the level.
You can phase through normal platforms when moving upwards, you teleport to
the other side of the screen if you go off the edge. You can stand on rainbow platforms,
grey objects kill the player, the level is slowly consumed in grey from the bottom to the top.

Pausing the game causes the game to slow down to 1% speed for 5 seconds upon resuming the game,
there will be a visible countdown to make you aware of when the games speed will return to 100%.
